        "            - Then yes, the system is in compliance with a regulatory limit of 2.5 [kg/(1000 m)].\n",
        "        - If system output is more than 2.5 [kg/(1000 m)],\n",

        "##### Final Answer\n",
        "- The final answer shows that the CRUD concentration is variable over the total distance of the river, x + 15 [km]. The output based on solving the differential equation prints the term,\"CRUD Wastewater Discharge Regulatory Limit Exceeded\". \n",
        "\n",
        "##### Specific Reference to Modeling Results\n",
        "- Chose a step size of 0.005 when solving the differential equation and saving. Saving at each step size of 0.05 provided adequate, but still thorough, insights into how the concentration changes over the change in distance.\n",
        "- Based on the output of the model, the associated CRUD concentration values as distance along the river increased from 0 to x + 15 [km], it is evident that the CRUD concentration changed based on which segment was being solved for at a specific distance as the inflow traveled the full distance of the river. \n",
        "    - Segment 1, from 0 to 15 [km]: the river inflow accumulates CRUD discharge concentration from source 1. The model also accounts for the CRUD decay rate in this segment. \n",
        "    - Segment 2, from 15 to x + 15 [km]: in this segment, the river inflow accumulates CRUD discharge concentration from source 2 in addition to source 1. Therefore, the total discharge in this segment accounts for the CRUD source discharge from both sources, as well as the overall CRUD decay rate for the sources. The concentration reflects this second inflow by showing a more significant increase in CRUD concentration in segment 2 as compared to segment 1. \n",
        "- The printed output,\"CRUD Wastewater Discharge Regulatory Limit Exceeded,\" shows that the limit of 2.5 [kg/(1000 m)] was exceeded by the simulated river model. As such, the regulatory limit for CRUD wastewater discharge was exceeded and therefore does not adhere to the environmental safety regulation. As such, it would be wise to investigate solutions for this issue so that the regulatory limit of 2.5 [kg/(1000 m)] is no longer exceeded. Exceeding the CRUD discharge limit could cause harm to aquatic organisms and habitats, which could result in a reinforcing feedback mechanism that then causes amplifications in system instability. Due to negative aquatic organism and habitat consequences, further river disruption could result in the form of bioaccumulation in those organisms that can be spread to other sources. \n",
        "    - Rectification based on Modeling Results: it would be wise to investigate the possibility of reduction in source discharges, as a total of 100,000 [m^(3)/day] flows into the river from both sources. This amount could potentially be diverted and/or reduced to allow for a reduction in CRUD wastewater discharge entering the river. \n",

Equilibria occurs where delta(X) = X_(t+1) - X_t = 0, so the outflows and sediment recycling are in balance. However, the equilibria can change as system parameters vary. At steady state, the equilibria equation shows that inflows and recycling are balanced with the outflows of the system and P's concentration is a constant value.  \n",

        "    - Interpretation of derivation: this equation is used in the resimulation portion of the shallow lake model. a_t, the point-source P release, is increased from 0 to 0.02, and this equation is applied to the simulation to show how a point-source P release can affect the shallow lake system's P concentrations over time, as well as its' increased values' effects on resilience of the shallow lake. \n",

        "##### Final Answer\n",
        "- First simulation iteration, where a_t was initialized as a_t = 0:\n",

        "- Based on the Final Answer section, both initial equilibria values shifted based on the redefining of the a_t variable to 0.02, rather than it's initial value of 0. \n",
        "- Implications of bifurcations: system dynamics uncertainties can dramatically change equilibria critical points, which can cause system behavior and equilibrium states to change. Additionally, shocks in the form of sedimentation/recycling disturbances or excessive non-pount source inflows can cause irreversible system outcome alterations. \n",
        "    - It is necessary to examine the impacts of bifrucations on shallow lake models because drastic changes in P concentration inflows could cause irreversible damage to the system. As exhibited in the Final Answer section, equilibria 1 was originally equal to 0.38196601125010543 where the P inflow was originally set to 0, but shifted to a value of 0.15442860418310414 where the P inflow was redefined to be set to 0.02. Furthermore, equilibria 2 was originally equal to 1.0000000000000002 where the P inflow was originally set to 0, but shifted to a value of 1.1341008852434815 where the P inflow was redefined to be set to 0.02. This shifting in values represents the value of simulation the shallow lake model, and other similar models, to examine effects of bifurcations such as increasing P inflow concentrations and the potentially irreversible negative effects it could have on the overall system.\n",
        "- Feedback: reinforcing or dampening of feedbacks cause system state amplifications for instability and evolution away from equilibrium state or reversion to stable equilibrium state.\n",
        "    - As exhibited in the Final Answer section, equilibria 1 was originally equal to 0.38196601125010543 where the P inflow was originally set to 0, but shifted to a value of 0.15442860418310414 where the P inflow was redefined to be set to 0.02.

Therefore, a reinforcing feedback mechanism with increased P inflow can drive the shallow lake system further from equilibria and amplify disturbances and overall impacts on its health. Based on the outputs, the shift in this simulation and resimulation was small and thereby exhibits system resiliency since the increasing P inflow a_t did not significantly change the equilibria states of the system. However, further increasing the P inflow concentration, a_t, could reduce system resiliency based on the reinforcing feedback mechanism and thus amplify disturbances to the shallow lake."
